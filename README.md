## Vagrant

When it comes to vagrant, this is our development environment. It is the operating system, libraries, and encapsulated workspace in which we will work on projects for a particular company or for a particular piece of software. It is common to have many vagrant machines (virtual machines inside your OS) for various projects, and developers can be expected to have to set up a virtual machine when joining a new company.
